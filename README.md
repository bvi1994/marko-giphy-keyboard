# Welcome to the Marko GIPHY Keyboard Example

Thanks for checking out this repo. This repo contains the completed source code for the GIPHY Live Search in Marko as well as the Marko down for the tutorial that teaches someone how to make the GIPHY Live Search App.

[The Markdown for the new Tutorial](https://github.com/bvi1994/marko-keyboard-example/blob/master/tutorial.md).

If you're going to run the application directly, first, make sure you get a GIPHY API Key. You can find it
[here](https://developers.giphy.com/docs/api/#quick-start-guide). Then create a .constants file that we will use to access the API key that we got from .giphy. In marko-giphy-keyboard, create a script called APIKEY.constants.js. Then in that file, save the following line:

```export const GIPHYAPIKEY = `Insert your GIPHY API Key in between the backtacks`;```

That's it! The code from the master branch should be able to run with `npm run dev` (after you run `npm install`)

If you have any suggestions on how to improve the tutorial, feel free to open a PR or send contact me at brvi [at] ebay [dot] com. This is currently a WIP that will be featured on the Marko website! :)
